# Really-Bad-AI
A really bad ai that can guess -x (trained on 1, 0, and -1).

I'm currently writing a version in c++ and hopefully it will be fast enough to do some sort of auto correct. I'm hoping to mess around with the AI although I'm really not sure how much more work I will actually put into it.
